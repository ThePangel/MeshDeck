## 11/3/2025 - Research  

So I want to get into Meshtastic, with a standalone device, but those are expensive, and it be fu to make my own, so inspired by the LILYGO T-Deck I started to research all the components and such, with help from the Meshtastic discord, for now I have the ESP32-S3, a GPS and LoRA module and some components for the battery charging/power circuit.

I still have to add the battery, battery charging IC and all the capacitors resistors and such that work with these components, I have to make my own keyboard and add a screen! (Plus, power, boot and such buttons)
