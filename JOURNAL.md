## 11/3/2025 - Research  

So I want to get into Meshtastic, with a standalone device, but those are expensive, and it be fu to make my own, so inspired by the LILYGO T-Deck I started to research all the components and such, with help from the Meshtastic discord, for now I have the ESP32-S3, a GPS and LoRA module and some components for the battery charging/power circuit.

I still have to add the battery, battery charging IC and all the capacitors resistors and such that work with these components, I have to make my own keyboard and add a screen! (Plus, power, boot and such buttons)

## 11/5/2025 - Research and some circuit building  

So I've been all afternoon reading datasheets and documentation, It's a lot lmao, but I have some circuit build, added usb and powwr supply for the esp, next I need to handle battery charging, step down tp 3.3V, the keyboard etc etc

## 11/9/2025 3 PM - Charging IC circuit   

After like an a couple of hours of reading a datasheet, finding components, etc, I have finished my charging circuit with the BQ24074RGTR as the brains!

## 11/9/2025 4 PM - Added 3.3V step down converter  

To step down the battery voltage to 3.3V i added a TPS6282533DMQ set down converter, to be able to power all my 3.3V components safely, rated for 2A it should be enough.

## 11/9/2025 5 PM - Added crystal oscillator and also tidied up the schematic   

I added a 32.768KHz crystal as an external clocked like stated in the esp datasheet, it is optional but I rather include it because wifi and ble require precise timing, I also made subsheets, also the boot button
